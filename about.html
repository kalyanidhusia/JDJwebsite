          <h2><u>Who I Am</u></h2>
          <p>
            I’m Joseph Johns, founder of JDJ Insight Partners — a consultancy built on
            rigorous economic-policy analysis and a commitment to clarity, transparency,
            and actionable insight for tax policy practitioners and state and local
            policy organizations.
          </p>

          <p>
            JDJ Insight Partners was created to provide innovative, responsible, and
            sustainable solutions to state and local tax and fiscal policy challenges.
            The work is grounded in careful empirical methods and a realistic view of
            institutional, legal, and political constraints.
          </p>

          <h2><u>What JDJ Insight Partners Brings</u></h2>
          <p>
            JDJ Insight Partners draws on experience that spans academia, policy
            workshops, and national non-profits. The goal is to bring the same level of
            service and care to clients that scholars bring to peer-reviewed research.
          </p>

          <p>
            The firm’s portfolio includes multiple publications related to state and
            local tax policy, as well as media appearances and op-eds on topics such as
            individual income tax reform efforts across multiple states and more
            specialized tax policy questions.
          </p>

          <h2><u>Background and Perspective</u></h2>
          <p>
            My work has roots in my time as a policy-oriented MA Fellow at the Mercatus
            Center at George Mason University and as a Policy Analyst at the Tax
            Foundation. Those roles gave me a deep understanding of economic frameworks,
            state and local tax and fiscal policy, and their real-world implications.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic and professional experience has centered on translating complex
            data and policy nuance into practical guidance for clients, stakeholders,
            and decision-makers. I have helped policymakers and external contributors to
            tax reform efforts craft robust, reliable, and sustainable policy solutions
            that aim to serve both taxpayers and client interests.
          </p>

          <h2><u>How I Work</u></h2>
          <p>
            I founded JDJ Insight Partners to bridge the gap between raw numbers and
            policy decisions. I use analytical rigor and a data-driven mindset to help
            organizations understand how shifting tax, regulatory, or economic
            conditions can affect their operations and long-term goals — and to chart a
            course that balances risk, compliance, and opportunity.
          </p>

          <p>
            JDJ Insight Partners is built on digging into the details — tax codes,
            economic indicators, empirical models, and interactive data visualization
            tools — and surfacing the insights that matter. The focus is not just on
            scholarship, but on what works for practitioners and policymakers who need
            clear and timely guidance.
          </p>

          <p>
            I value clarity, transparency, and communication. Even dense policy analysis
            should be accessible to the people who rely on it to make decisions.
          </p>

          <h2><u>Let’s Connect</u></h2>
          <p>
            If you are looking for clear-headed, realistic, and actionable analysis of
            the policy and tax environment — especially at the state and local level —
            I’d be glad to talk.
